  <h2>🧰 Helpful Equipment</h2>
  <p>These simple tools can help you spot early signs of fluid build-up.</p>

  <!-- Weighing scales -->
  <details>
    <summary><strong>⚖️ Weighing scales — why are they important?</strong></summary>
    <p>
      Daily weight is one of the earliest and most reliable ways to detect fluid build-up.
      An increase in weight over a short period is often due to fluid rather than body fat
      and may happen before swelling or breathlessness is noticeable.
    </p>
  </details>

  <!-- Blood pressure monitor -->
  <details>
    <summary><strong>🩺 Blood pressure monitor — why might this help?</strong></summary>
    <p>
      Blood pressure and heart rate can change when fluid levels are too high or too low.
      Monitoring this at home can help you and your heart failure team understand how your
      body is responding to treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also provides useful information that helps your clinical team choose the best
      combination of medications for you, if they have advised you to monitor it.
